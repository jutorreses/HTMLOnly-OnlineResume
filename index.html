    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      I am a curious individual, always looking for new knowledge, hobbies or
      skills. I would call myself an adventurous thrill seeker, always on the
      move and ready for an adrenaline rush. Talk to me about anything: food,
      music, linguistics, technology, space, philosophy or even how your day is
      going.
